# Event Scheduling Application Development Plan

This README outlines the development plan for the event scheduling application, with a phased approach focusing first on establishing core scheduling functionalities before adding the labor management system.

## Phase 1: Core Event Scheduling

### Tasks

- [ ] **Setup Project Structure**: Initialize the project with basic module files and a Git repository.
  - `main.py`
  - `calendar.py`
  - `edit.py`
  - `input.py`
  - `report.py`
  - `save_calendar.py`
  - `config.py`

- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Develop `config.py` to handle dynamic configurations like room lists.
  - [ ] Load room configurations from an external file.
  - [ ] Allow easy updates to configuration without altering the source code.

- [ ] **Event Management System** (`calendar.py`):
  - [ ] Create a pandas DataFrame to hold event data.
  - [ ] Implement functions to add, edit, and delete events.
  - [ ] Ensure data integrity within the DataFrame for event scheduling.

- [ ] **User Interface** (`main.py`):
  - [ ] Implement command line parsing for event operations using `argparse`.
  - [ ] Define commands for adding, editing, viewing, and deleting events.

- [ ] **Event Viewing** (`report.py`):
  - [ ] Integrate `tabulate` for displaying events in a tabular format.
  - [ ] Allow viewing events by day, week, and month.

- [ ] **Data Persistence** (`save_calendar.py`):
  - [ ] Implement functionality to export the calendar to CSV and Excel formats.
  - [ ] Setup automatic saving mechanism for changes.

- [ ] **Testing and Validation**:
  - [ ] Create unit tests for each functional part of the application.
  - [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Phase 2: Labor Management System

### Tasks

- [ ] **Extend Data Model**:
  - [ ] Add labor hours and calculation logic to the DataFrame structure in `calendar.py`.

- [ ] **Labor Calculation Functionality**:
  - [ ] Develop functions to calculate the number of labor shifts required based on event times and purchased labor hours.

- [ ] **Update Event Editing** (`edit.py`):
  - [ ] Ensure that changes to event times or labor hours trigger recalculations of labor requirements.

- [ ] **Enhance Reporting** (`report.py`):
  - [ ] Add detailed labor requirement reports, including workers needed and shift durations.

- [ ] **User Interface Enhancements** (`main.py`):
  - [ ] Add CLI options to manage labor details for events.

- [ ] **Testing and Validation for Labor Features**:
  - [ ] Update tests to cover new labor management functionalities.
  - [ ] Conduct thorough testing to ensure that labor calculations are accurate and reliable.

## Documentation

- [ ] **Update README**: Continuously update the README as development progresses.
- [ ] **Developer Documentation**: Ensure all code is well-documented, explaining the purpose and function of each module and method.

## Deployment

- [ ] **Prepare Deployment**: Set up necessary environments and verify that the application runs smoothly in production settings.
- [ ] **User Training**: Provide documentation and training for end-users on how to use the application effectively.
